# write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8    
# warning Do not change the code on line 1. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g any two-digit number.
# The last line of your program should be the print the result.

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
first_digit = int(two_digit_number[0])
second_digit = int(two_digit_number[1])

# Add the two digits together
result = first_digit + second_digit
